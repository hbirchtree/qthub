What is GithubQit?
==================
GithubQit is a Qt framework for interacting with the Github REST API.

Inside are several projects:

 - libgithub - This is the library part that can be included as a static or shared library. Usual restrictions around Qt's license apply.
 - github-cli - An example CLI application for interacting with the Github API, making it possible to headlessly do a lot of different tasks around repositories.
 - github-qml - An example GUI application that (at some point) will make it possible to browse Github repositories.

Why does this exist?
====================
I needed to delete a lot of releases made by Appveyor CI. This endeavour might have taken more time than doing it manually.
